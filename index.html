<h2>About</h2>
<p>This is a simple utility to test <a href="http://www.trms.com/signage">Carousel's</a> Remote Data Adaptor (RDA) functionality. RDA is a socket-based protocol that is used to control certain functionality within Carousel. For a full description of RDA, please see the Carousel <a href="http://www.trms.com/community/documentation">documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a list of commands that RDA currently supports:</p>
<ul>
  <li>CreatePage</li>
  <li>UpdatePage</li>
  <li>CreateAlertPage</li>
  <li>CreateCrawl</li>
  <li>ChangePageStatus</li>
  <li>DeletePage</li>
  <li>DeleteAllUserPages</li>
  <li>DeactivateAllAlertPages</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
  After launching the application, you'll see the RDA window:
  <a href="images/CarouselRDA_TesterApp.png"><img alt="The RDA Screen" src="images/CarouselRDA_TesterApp.png" width="600" /></a>
</p>
<p>
  There are four areas on this window:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Connect</strong>: Enter the IP Address or name of your Carousel server, and the RDA port (by default, 56906). The <em>Connect</em> button will connect the application to your Carousel server. You will need to be connected to the server before any commands can be sent.</li>
    <li><strong>Sample Commands</strong>: This is a list of sample XML commands that you can send to the server. Select a command, and click the <em>Send to command window</em> button to copy the command to the Send Commands area.</li>
    <li><strong>Send Commands</strong>: This text box is where you can enter an XML command to send to the server. You can type your own command, or use a pre-built command from the <em>Sample Commands</em> area. The sample commands can be edited within this text box. The <em>Send Command</em> button will send the XML command to the server (assuming you are connected).</li>
    <li><strong>Response List</strong>: Any responses from the server will be listed in this area. You should see both error and success messages.  The <em>Clear Responses</em> button will clear the list.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Procedure</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Enter the IP address and RDA port for your Carousel server in the <em>Connect</em> area. Click the <em>Connect</em> button. You should see &quot;Connected&quot; in the <em>Response</em> area, and the <em>Connect</em> button should change to say "Disconnect."
      <a href="images/connected.png"><img alt="A successful connection" src="images/connected.png" width="600" /></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you see "A connection attempt failed," double check that you entered the correct server information. This message is telling you that the application cannot connect to your Carousel server. The server information you entered may be incorrect, or the server might not be licensed for RDA.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      After you have connected, select a sample command to send to the server. Click on a command in the <em>Sample Commands</em> list, then click the <em>Send to command window</em> button. The command you selected will be copied to the command text area.
      <a href="images/selecting_commands.png"><img alt="Selecting a command to send to the server" src="images/selecting_commands.png" width="600" /></a>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Make any edits to the command that you need.  A common change is to update the username and password to correspond to a user with access to execute this type of command on the selected Zone.
      <a href="images/update_command.png"><img alt="Updating the RDA command" src="images/update_command.png" width="600" /></a>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the command is ready, click the <em>Send Command</em> button. The command will be sent to the server, and executed if valid.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      After sending the command, review the <em>Response List</em> for the result. You'll see a status of either "Error" or "Success" and a description.
    </p>
    <p>
      Error results should have a description of what went wrong. Success results should have a description that contains what the server did, plus any additional information such as a page identifier (GUID) or any warnings that occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the image below, you can see three commands were executed. The first command failed because the username or password were incorrect, or the user didn't have access to execute the command on the specified zone.  The second command failed because the template specified didn't exist on the zone.  The third command succeeded in creating a new bulletin with GUID d55609(...), however the command specified some text for a block that didn't exist in the template.  The bulletin was still created, it just might not contain the text that you expected.
